# Poisonous Mushroom Prediction

The 'Poisonous Mushroom Prediction' repository in GitHub is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible based on its physical characteristics. The repository contains a dataset of over 8000 mushroom samples, with each sample having various attributes such as cap shape, odor, and habitat. The project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms such as 'Logistic Regression', 'Naive Bayes', 'K Nearest Neighbors', 'Decision Tree', 'Random Forest' and 'Support Vector Machine' to build and train predictive models that can classify mushrooms as poisonous or edible based on their physical characteristics.

The repository contains all the necessary code and documentation to reproduce the results of the project. It includes Jupyter Notebooks that explain the data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling steps in detail. The code is written in Python and uses popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Numpy.

The project's goal is to create a robust and accurate predictive model that can be used to prevent mushroom poisoning incidents.
